Several years ago me and friend of mine developed useful and nice components for Borland Delphi and Borland Builder. We managed to sell reasonable number of licenses as well. However as Borland tools are sunsetting, we decided to contributed them to sf.net:

[Balmsoft Wizard](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bswizard/)

[Balmsoft Polyglot](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bspolyglot/)

 
If you are still with Borland Delphi <=7 you are welcome to try and enjoy.
